# A4 Summary

I was not able to complete my back0end implementation. I found the typing (choosing what data should be represented with what types) took much longer than I had anticipated, so I ran out of time. On the one hand, I wanted to globalize my types so that they are reachable from any other fles (this is my types.ts file). Also, my enums moved from just enumeration to storing the sub-paths of the router easier. Going through the iterative process of choosing a type, moving on to another piece, and realizing I needed to come back and revise my previous decisions was time consuming. I eventually found myself straying very far from my original design from A3: not because my functions fundamentally changed but rather because I would not say I understood the typing notation we used in A3 and its connection to ObjectId used by Mongo.

While I do think that this exercise wasn't a success by any means, I feel that I'm learning from my failure and developing my tacit knowledge. After A4, I feel more comfortable developing backend processes using document database solutions, like MongoDB.
