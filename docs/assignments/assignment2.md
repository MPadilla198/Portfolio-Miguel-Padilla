App Name:
# BLOCKS
My app is intended for people interested in coding. This includes people that are interested in programming but lack knowledge or experience about how. This app will be catering to a wide variety of skill levels, and our goal would be to cater to each one.

This app will offer detailed customization of your page and any data uploaded; most apps today give us finite, yet cumbersome, sets of options, or settings, that may work differently under the hood than we intend or want. 

## Scrapbook of Ideas!

### MIT App Inventor

MIT App Inventor allows for children of all ages to learn the fundamentals of programming. I am particularly interested in the modular and easy-to-use structure of the "codeless" platform.

### Shopify's Liquid

Most people probably know of Shopify as a platform to buy things from smaller online shops (also like Etsy), but what's probably less known is the technoogy that runs it in the back-end: a templating language called Liquid. This sort of templating language could be one way to cater to more experienced users that are perhaps more familiar with writing software.

### Wix
![Wix templates](/../assets/images/WixTemplates.jpeg)
Wix is another website building app, although it's a bit more general purpose. Here I liked the idea of starting templates that can get users' own creative juices going.

Having used Wix before, I will not claim that this builder is easy-to-use or lag-free, in fact it can be extremely frustrating at times. But the drag-and-drop feature of building a webpage is yet another way of opening the gates to more skill levels.

## Future Ideas
1. Timed - A set of functionality for handling sequences in time. This could be for creating/editing audio or animations or video graphics.
2. Groups - The ability to create sets of users that may then be used to customize ones page to different groups or individuals (e.g. friends, family, coworkers, etc.).
3. Feeds - This one is pretty much what it sounds like: RSS feed feature support. I know it's a bit of a dying technology, but I'm imagining journalists (like those that currently use twitter to disseminate information) that would like to present their own sources or news feeds for others to see (or craft them for others).
4. Albums - Groups of photos and videos, similar in concept to the "Groups" feature above.
5. Takeover - The ability to download data from users' own accounts on any other social media to add to their pages. This is not general scraping as the feature would allow the user to download only from uploads of accounts that they have the ability to log into. We could even add an option to download all of their data and delete their profile. 
6. Mapped - Allows users to map out any geological metadata (I'm thinking particularly of images and videos taken on smartphones, but I'll leave it open to all data formats that support geo-location data). Customizable features based on the data or the location on the map, etc.
7. Block Sharing - Say you made something for your page that your friend saw and really likes. With block sharing, you could open pieces (blocks) of codes to the general public or to "groups" of people.
8. Embeds - Specific support for displaying content from another site (like embedding tweets in web pages or perhaps embedding a MASA live feed from YouTube onto a page).
9. HyperLinks - Link your other social media pages. This will initially begin with a limited set of social media sites, but will be open to user request for the future support of more.
10. Template Forms - Say you want to start a blog: every blog post has a title, possibly a subtitle, a body, possibly a header and footer, etc. To make it easy to make new blog posts in this scenario you would use a template that would then generate a form that allows easy input of a new instance of data for said template. 
11. Input Device Agnostic - Plug a joystick into your computer or a PS5/XBox controller, whatever feels best or works best for you. This would open the door for different ways of traversing the web page.
12. Disability Visibility Highlights - This will notify users when they're not taking advantage of existing web technologies that help those with impairments, such as metadata for screen readers or captioning services.
13. Singles - Imagine you want to make a flyer or banner for mass distribution. Create a single web page (that may or may not be publicly connected to your personal user page) that stands alone and has a short url for easy sharing.
14. Academy - Not only do we want to cater to all skill levels, we want to make it as easy as possible for users to move up and down the ladder of skill as they please with well-documented resources to learn. 
15. Design Interface Agnostic - Say you normally like using the templating language to customize your site, but you're having trouble imagining just how large an image will display. Switch over to the drag-and-drop feature (which has maintained the state of your previous code) and drag the image to the size you want and into the position you'd like.
16. Timeline - This is very similar to other social medias however, here we want to emphasize that what is added to this timeline will be seen on the content feeds of their friends. This is where users post things to be shared with others without them having to visit your page, say a post of your cute dog.
17. User-Earned Ads - Do you have friends that you really hate deep down? What to give them an ad riddled experience while your other friends get ad free-experience? Would you feel better knowing that you made a few cents worth of ad dollars from that one "friend"? Add ads to your page and scope them to limited groups!

## VSD Analysis

- Sustained Freindships - Every friendship is different: from the frequency of contact to the length of the chats when together. I would hope that this platform, utilizing the deep customization features and the "groups" feature above that friends could design their own interfaces for communication.

- Choosing Not to Use - Allowing our users to customize their experience on our site, such as allowing users to change the algorithms used to display content, gives users the space to not have their experience optimized for constant consumption.

- Political Realities - I could see those on the extremes of both sides of the aisles coming to the site to generate support for their causes. While this would be a boon for free speech, it could also be used to sread hate-speech. Content moderation, as with any social media these days, will very much be needed (despite what certain billionaires have to say about it).

- Crossing National Boundaries - Complying with data regulations around the world (expecially Europe) would be a must if we were to be international. Given our open and transperent design, we would build features with data regulation in mind.

- Consider Children - Considering that we are taking inspiration from MIT App Inventor for it's ease-of-use, we need to keep in mind the fact that our system might be easy enough to use by children. Considering the impact that social media can have on children, I would lean towards excluding children from the platform, in general.
