# Assignment 1

## Interview Plan
I think that today's social media apps are limited to the features that software designers implements, i.e. there is no way, yet, to change not only the layout but also the algorithms used to curate content. I'm imagining a social media that gives users control over how they view and "rank" content, and these "mods" are able to be shared between users.

Understanding that the average person does not know how to code, I would need to interview people that don't necessarily understand the technology/software to understand if this hunch has any broad traction or appeal. I can see how this setup could potentially provide people with solutions to their personal gripes with traditional social media, however it would not be immediately apparent how, or even if, it would be possible.

### Questions to Start the Conversation
- When do you typically find yourself stepping away from social media apps?
- Have you ever opened a social media app only to close itshortly after because the content served was unwanted or uninteresting?
- Are there any particular updates to a social media app that you associate with reason to stop engaging? Maybe a major UI update or algorithm update?

## Interview Report
Both interviews were with friends whose careers are in no way related to computer or data science. Closer to the end of the interviews, I laid out my hunch to both interviewees that more granular control over the layout and/or function would add to the user experience. It took some explaining with different analogies, but one participant expressed the more general needs for such a feature: they found the limited number of sorting options available on Amazon.com's product search to be an inconvenience (The gripe was, specifically, that you could sort by product reviews but not filter based on the number of reviews).

Overall, the intake was that points of frustration typically exist for a user of any social media app, but this can span not only content, layout, and algorithms but also stability or availability of the network. Converning this point, one participant expressed recent frustration with their favorite social media app, Twitter or X, over its increasing instability: inconsistent features, unreliable access due to bugs or supposed outages. These seem to be pretty basic needs for a social media app and not a problem that may be solved only with web design. This seems to become particularly important to people that depend on social media for alerts or news.

## Design Opportunities
- How can algorithms be opened up? What would it mean for users to be able to curate their own media, empowered with the cloud? 
- How does education fit into the social network? There would be a social incentive to learn to code to customize your profile and your experience, so how could we make it easier for beginners or non-users to engage with the possibilities?
- Interviewees aren't designers, but they can judge designs. The ability to view the network from a friend's personalized perspective would offer the opportunity to see what is possible and how to recreate the desired layouts or view on your own.
- Twitter was popular to some people as a go-to spot for up-to-date information or breaking news, and this seems to be a need that grows as social media platforms seem to become less unreliable or more complex to the average user.
