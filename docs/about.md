My name is Miguel Padilla. I'm a course 6-3. 

I grew up in Fort Worth, Texas and lived in Austin for a few years before eventually finding my way to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I appreciated the initial reading because I found the introduction to be very true: I have experience with staic site generators and front end-frameworks (Vue.js and Angular), yet I never encountered basic definitions or general ideas. Everything seemed to be within the context of that particular framework. So, I guess what I look forward to the most is extending my understanding of basic concepts of full-stack web development and taking advantage of the opportunity to practice my programming and (albeit, limited) design skills.
